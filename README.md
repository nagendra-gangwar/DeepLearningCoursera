* This repository contains the details and analysis I completed on Andrew Ng's special course  "[***Deep Learning Specialization***](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)" This course consists of five courses: 
    * [***Neural Networks and Deep Learning***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) Â 
    * [***Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome) 
    * [***Structuring Machine Learning Projects***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/home/welcome)
    * [***Convolutional Neural Networks***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)
    * [***Sequence Models***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)
    
    For now I have completed the first four courses
